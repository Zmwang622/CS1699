# CS 1699
Course description: This course will cover the basics of modern deep neural networks. The first part of the course will introduce neural network architectures, activation functions, and operations. It will present different loss functions and describe how training is performed via backpropagation. In the second part, the course will describe specific types of neural networks, e.g. convolutional, recurrent, and graph networks, as well as their applications in computer vision and natural language processing. The course will also briefly discuss reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning, in the context of neural networks. In addition to attending lectures and completing bi-weekly homework assignments, students will also carry out and present a project.

Prerequisites: Math 220 (Calculus I), Math 280 or 1180 (Linear Algebra), CS 1501 (Algorithm Implementation)

Piazza: Sign up for it here. Please use Piazza rather than email so everyone can benefit from the discussion-- you can post in such a way that only the instructor sees your name. Please try to answer each others' questions whenever possible. The best time to ask the instructor or TA questions is during office hours.

Programming language/framework: We will use Python, NumPy/SciPy, and PyTorch.

Textbooks: We will have required readings from the following textbook.
Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. Deep Learning. MIT Press, 2016. online version
There will also be additional readings from published papers. The following textbooks are useful as additional reference:
